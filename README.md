# mipslanguage README

An Extenson that offers syntax highlighting and 'go to definition' for the mips
assembly language. This is still a work in progress and I would love to add a
lot more functionality over time. Currently, 'go to definition' only looks in
the current folder, not the entire workspace, since that is what I wanted.
Supports .asm and .s files. If you enjoy this extension and would like improved
or increased functionality, please create an issue or let me know.
